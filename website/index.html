<h2 id="vision-statement">Vision Statement</h2>
<p>The University Textbook Trading Application (UTTA) will allow students to buy and sell textbooks and course materials from other students. It will allow for students to sell and post their used course material and also allow students to purchase them, similar to Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji. Unlike other online marketplaces, UTTA is targeted towards students, and enables students to easily find what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>UTTA will feature the ability to post course material up for sale with prices for each book. A seller is required to tag the particular course in which the book belongs to, thus enabling easy searches and preventing spam posts. With postings being categorized according to course code, the buyer is able to focus their searches to only related postings. When a buyer is interested in a posting, the seller can be contacted (via institution email) by the buyer to reach an agreement on the sale.</p>
<p>Buyers and sellers are restricted to students and staff of the particular institution, to limit spam and external postings. This allows for buyers and sellers to see and post material that is specifically relevant to them. This is a contrast to other marketplace applications where users are forced to deal with and look through items that are irrelevant.</p>
<p>UTTA will focus on students as its main users, as well as instructors or TAs in the University of Manitoba campus. For all users, this application will make searching and buying/selling books easier as it is more “book trading-oriented” and more locality than other online trading websites and features such as Amazon or Facebook Market. Better locality leads to more accuracy in searching as most of the required books for courses will be close to the user (for example, the UofM campus).</p>
<p>UTTA will be considered successful based on the following criteria. First being sellers are able to find a market for their used course material, as in there are enough users that are looking to purchase such material. Another being buyers are are able to find material for their specific courses. The above can be measured by the amount of buyer/seller interaction (are buyers interested in the posts) and the amount of posts. Another criteria to consider is the variety of users, as in there are buyers and sellers from numerous faculties and departments. Success can be determined by the amount of courses for which material is available.  If any one of these criteria show a significant improvement at the beginning and end of semesters, without a statistically‐significant reduction in the other, the application will be considered a success.</p>
<h2 id="intended-users">Intended Users</h2>
<p>UTTA is for students that want the supplement of knowledge provided by a textbook without the supplement to tuition fees normally added by buying a new textbook.</p>
<p>Beyond that, our app is for students that are tired of sifting through spam and postings for classes they&rsquo;ve never even heard of to find a good deal for a textbook.</p>
<h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>
<p>UTTA allows users to make and view postings for textbooks. Postings can be viewed by Course, by Faculty, or as a list of every posting at the user&rsquo;s specific institution.</p>
<p>Viewing a posting allows the user to see the name of the book, a description of its condition, whether or not the previous owner highlighted any of the text, price, and the name of the seller.</p>
<p>When a user finds a book that they&rsquo;d like to purchase, they can contact the seller through their institution email only. This is to prevent people unaffiliated with the institution from making spam postings.</p>

<h2 id="why-utta">Why UTTA?</h2>
<p>We are the future of knowledge-exchange. We strive towards a world where anyone, at any school can advertise information and find what they need. Where there is no spam cluttering up the legitimate textbook postings. That is what UTTA is for, and what students the world over need.</p>

<h1 id="postmortem">Postmortem</h1>
<p>There were a few big changes from iteration 0 to now. We were originally going to have a tagging system and allow users to search by specific tags. We were also going to have users able to interact within the app itself, whether with notifications or an actual messaging system, but that was also discarded. Finally, we were going to allow pictures for the books but we decided against that feature in the end as well.</p>
<p>We learned a lot about dividing up the work. This was a very new experience in terms of combining a semester long project with actual coding. The project also taught us some valuable lessons about version control systems and the importance of using them in this kind of project. There were a few times that we had to roll back to an earlier version because something went horribly wrong.</p>
<p>The biggest conclusion to draw from this project is that in the professional world, there aren&rsquo;t nearly as many single-person projects. Knowing how to do use version control and how to work as a team is essential to succeed in the future as a software engineer.</p>
