# Vision Statement For UTTA

**UOM TEXTBOOK TRADING APPLICATION VISION STATEMENT**

The University Textbook Trading Application (UTTA) will allow students to buy and sell textbooks and other course material from their classmates. It will allow for students to sell and post their used course material and also allow students to purchase them, similar to Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji. Unlike other online marketplaces, UTTA is targeted towards students, and enables students to easily find what they’re looking for.

UTTA will feature the ability to post course material up for sale along with the photo(s) and prices for each book. A seller is required to tag the particular course in which the book belongs to, thus enabling easy searches and preventing spam posts. With postings being categorized according to course code, the buyer is able to focus their searches to only relevant postings. In case there is no result from the search, buyers can be informed when the desired book is available. When a buyer is interested in a posting, the seller is contacted (via institution email) with contact information of the buyer to instigate communication. 

Buyers and sellers are restricted to students and staff of the particular institution, to limit spam and external postings. This allows for buyers and sellers to see and post material that is specifically relevant to them. This is a contrast to other marketplace applications where users are forced to deal with and look through items that are irrelevant.

UTTA will focus on students as its main users, as well as instructors or TAs in the University of Manitoba campus. For all users, this application will make searching and buying/selling books easier as it is more “book trading-oriented” and local than other online trading websites and features such as Amazon or Facebook Market. Better locality leads to more accuracy in searching as most of the required books for courses will be close to the user (for example, the UofM campus).

UTTA will be considered successful based on the following criteria. First being sellers are able to find a market for their used course material, as in there are enough users that are looking to purchase such material. Another being buyers are are able to find material for their specific courses. The above can be measured by the amount of buyer/seller interactions (are buyers interested in the posts) and the amount of posts. Another criteria to consider is the variety of users, as in there are buyers and sellers from numerous faculties and departments. Success can be determined by the amount and variety of courses for which material is available.  If any one of these criteria show a significant improvement at the beginning and end of semesters, without a statistically‐significant reduction in the other, the application will be considered a success.
